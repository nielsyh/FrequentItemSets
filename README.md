# FrequentItemSets
Comparing Riandato and Toivonen approach for FIM

# Sample size
Sample size Riondato is based on the following paper: Efficient discovery of association rules and frequent itemsets through sampling with tight performance guarantees. Where toivonen is based on EfÔ¨Åcient Algorithms for Discovering Association Rules.

# D-index
The Python main.py can calculate the D-bound of a dataset. This is an tight upperbound for the VC-dimension of a range space. WARNING: It does not handle infinite VC-dimensions.
